Learning avr prgoramming using courses from atnel. Examples are made in eclipse program using nano board.  

example_1:
set up Eclipse, tested microcontroller communication, and blinked an LED for verificatio

example_2:
Connected 10 LEDs to a breadboard with their cathodes linked to the microcontroller. The LEDs light up sequentially.
